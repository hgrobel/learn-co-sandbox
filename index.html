    <p id="text1">1) Female werewolves by the name Nattmara appear as skinny young women, dressed in a night gown, with pale skin and long black hair and nails. They terrorize the villagers by "riding" on their chest as they sleep and giving them nightmares. They were also seen as an omen of death, for if a dirty doll was left in the livingroom, someone in the family would soon die of disease.
    <br>2) Trolls are believed to be stupid, slow, and easily defeated by any brave committed mortal. They come in any form and dwell in dark, musty places like the bottom of lakes and caves. Their king is called Dovregubben, who lives inside the Dovre Mountains with his court.
    <br>3) The Dökkálfar, or dark elves, live within the earth and are very greedy and cunning. They are very powerful spirits closely linked to the seid magic. Most of them are female, and masters of seduction and trickery.</p>
